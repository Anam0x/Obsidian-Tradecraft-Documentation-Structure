# Todo

## Not Started

- [ ] Modify templates to include a Dataview query section that pulls all notes backlinked to that category
  - [ ] Footer or body?

- [ ] Modify the "Obsidian - Getting Started" note to indicate that this fork was created by Anam0x and inspired by TrustedSec

- [ ] Add style guide to root of vault
  - [ ] Split up the style guide into atomic notes
  - [ ] What should the difference between links in the "Resources" table and footnotes be?

- [ ] Git support
  - [ ] .gitignore
  - [ ] README
  - [ ] Update Obsidian Git note
  - [ ] Setup scripts
   - [ ] Bash for *NIX-like
   - [ ] PowerShell for Windows

## In Progress

### Highest Priority (Blocking Issues)

- [ ] Critical error handling
  - [ ] Sanitize file names
  - [ ] Infinite recursion in `getValidatedNoteTitle` and `getValidatedContentTypeTitle` (these two functions could probably be merged)
  - [ ] Templater plugin dependency (check if available first)
  - [ ] Validate template content before processing
  - [ ] Array bounds issues with `allEmojis` constant
  - [ ] Potentially reading stale metadata in `getAvailableContentTypes`

### High Priority (Core Functionality and Usability)

- [ ] Provide template for new content types (e.g., "Command", "Idea", "IOC")
  - [ ] Replace all blockquote template instances with admonition block-styled content
- [ ] Header/Footer template restructuring (impacts all new notes)
  - [ ] Replace "Header" with "Footer"
  - [ ] Create a utility function to add a dividing line between individual template structures
  - [ ] Remove the "Resources" table and footnotes from all content templates and move them to the new "Footer" element
  - [ ] Update main script
- [ ] Installation instructions (enables adoption)
  - [ ] README
  - [ ] Rewrite the "Vault Appendix - Modifying Vault Structure" note
  - [ ] Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS support
  - [ ] Automatically install, enable, configure required community plugins (if possible)

### Medium Priority (Enhancement)

- [ ] Add Python script to scrape MITRE ATT&CK Framework and generate TTP notes
- [ ] Personal/unfinished ideas directory
- [ ] Example notes for new content types (e.g., Command, Idea, IOC)
  - [ ] Consider adding example notes for each new content type

### Low Priority (Cleanup/Polish)

- [ ] Break up large notes (PowerView, Zettelkasten) to maintain principle of atomicity
- [ ] Race condition handling (low probability for personal use)
