## In Progress

### Highest Priority

- [ ] Add "special tags" for primary category titles; secondary categories should not be necessary
  - [ ] Update "Obsidian - Modifying Vault Structure" note to reflect changes

- [ ] Rename "Debrief" to "Case Study" and optionally change emoji (a "case study" covers both personal reflection post-engagement and formal analysis of publicly referenceable attacks/incidents)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Add more scripting logic
  - [ ] Prompt to pre-populate tags and aliases for all new categories and content notes
  - [ ] Prompt to pre-populate metadata links in new secondary categories with primary categories
  - [ ] Prompt to pre-populate metadata links in new content notes with primary and secondary categories
  - [ ] Adding and removing content types (e.g., "TTP", "Tool", "Basic")

- [ ] git support
  - [ ] .gitignore
  - [ ] Setup instructions added to README

### Lowest Priority

- [ ] Provide installation instructions (either in README or in a scripts directory)
  - [ ] Content page for modifying vault structure (i.e., primary/secondary categories, content types, templates)
    - [x] Instructions
    - [ ] GIFs
  - [ ] Linux, Windows, macOS support (at the very least, a dedicated section in the README)
  - [ ] Automatically install, enable, configure required community plugins

- [ ] Consider replacing `PowerView Enumeration Checklist` with a single `PowerView - Enumerate Users` note to maintain principle of atomicity

- [ ] Add style guide to root of vault
  - [ ] Split up the style guide into atomic notes
  - [ ] What should the difference between links in the "Resources" table and footnotes be?
