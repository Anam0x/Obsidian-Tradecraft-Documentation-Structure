# Obsidian-Vault-Structure

## Welcome to TrustedSec's Obsidian Vault!

This project was developed as part of TrustedSec's investigation into using Obsidian (https://obsidian.md/) as a collaborative knowledge management solution. The repository is a designed to be act as a complimentary resource to TrustedSec's original blog post (https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/obsidian-taming-a-collective-consciousness/) describing the vaults composition and use. 

Hopefully this repository's vault structure and automation templates help you and your team shortcut the process of spinning up and evaluating Obsidian!
