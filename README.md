# Obsidian Tradecraft Documentation Structure

## Overview

This project was inspired by TrustedSec's investigation into using Obsidian (https://obsidian.md/) as a collaborative knowledge management solution. The repository is designed to be used as a companion during offensive security consulting engagements and practical cybersecurity certification exams. The majority of the logical implementation was borrowed from TrustedSec's original blog post (https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/obsidian-taming-a-collective-consciousness/) describing the vaults composition and use; I have modified the vault to reflect my personal methodology and learning style.
